# MarketSphere: A Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform

Welcome to MarketSphere! This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL. It's designed to demonstrate my expertise in full-stack development, API creation and integration, user authentication, and responsive design.

## Project Description

MarketSphere is an e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases. Users can sign in, view their purchase history, and eventually create their own product pages. The application is designed to be scalable and evolve as more features are learned and implemented.

Please note: This project is purely for demonstration purposes and getting ready for my internship.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in using their email.
- **Product Browsing**: Users can browse through a variety of products.
- **Cart Functionality**: Users can add items to their cart and make purchases.
- **Purchase History**: Users can view their previous purchases.
- **Responsive Design**: The application features a clean UI and is responsive on all devices.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Full-Stack Development**: Built a complete web application using Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL.
- **API Creation & Integration**: Created an API from scratch and made API calls to fetch data.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented user authentication using email.
- **Responsive Design**: Created a mobile-friendly layout using media queries.

## Technical Details

MarketSphere is developed using Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL. It employs Angular for frontend development and Spring Boot for backend services. The application fetches data from a custom API to provide real-time user information. The layout and responsiveness are achieved using CSS.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance the app with the following features:

- **User Pages**: Allow users to create their own product pages.
- **Product Reviews**: Implement a system for users to review products.
- **Recommendation System**: Develop a recommendation system based on user behavior.
